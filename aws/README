"aws" is a command line program that accesses Amazon Web Services:

EC2
S3
SQS
SDB
ELB
IAM

To run "aws", all you need is a single file! Download http://github.com/timkay/aws/raw/master/aws, make it executable, create ~/.awssecrets or set EC2_ACCESS_KEY and EC2_SECRET_KEY, and you are done.

For more documentation, see http://timkay.com/aws/

If you can help improve the "aws" documentation, please let me know.
